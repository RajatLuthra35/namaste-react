React hooks are nothing just javaScript function given to us by react

when ever a state variable updates, react re-render the component.
jaha per bhi state variable update hua hai, us component ko re render kr dega react.

Question is HOW REACT DOES THIS?
ANSWER - React uses RECONCILIATION ALGORITHM also called REACT FIBER
ANYTHING THAT CHANGES ON UI IS CALLED RECONCILIATION.
Suppose there is res-container which contain 7 res-cards and upon filtering on specific condition(filter function)
3 res-cards remain. NOW HOW IS THIS DONE?
what react does is firstly react will make a VIRTUAL DOM.
WHAT IS DOM -> DOM IS TAGS. Like <div>, <img> nested tags etc.
VIRTUAL DOME -> representation of actual dom.
In this project we have body component <Body />, This is a virtual dom.
Entire component which return proper tags is actually VIRTUAL DOM.
if you console this we will get,
same object what we use get when we console React.createElement
so react consider all this as big object.

TO KNOW ANSWER TO PREVIOUS QUESTION WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS DIFF ALGO?
React uses DIFF ALGO, IT TRY OUT TO FIND OUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OLD VIRTUAL DOM AND NEW VIRTUAL DOM AND THEN IT WILL ACTUALLY
UPDATE THE DOM ON EVERY RENDER CYCLE.THIS IS DONE BY REACT AND THIS MAKE REACT FAST.
FINDING OUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO HTML CODE IS DIFFICULT, FINDING OUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 2 OBJECT IS FAST.
whatever ui we make, react keep track of all of it as object called as VIRTUAL DOM then whenever state is updated a new object is formed,
then react finds out difference between these two objects(firstly there were 15 restaurants now there are 7 restaurants so difference is found by react)
using diff algo then it actually update the DOM.React doesn't touch the dom alot.it play with virtual dom.THAT IS WHY REACT IS FAST.
REACT DOES EFFICIENT DOM MANIPULATION AS IT HAS VIRTUAL DOM AND IT UPDATE THE DOM(UI).



STATE VARIABLE - 
const [listOfRestaurants, setListOfRestaurants] = useState(resList);
here listOfRestaurants is a variable, setListOfRestaurants is a FUNCTION. Which is used to update the state.
CAREFULLY SEE WHAT THE ABOVE STATE IS => is is actually ARRAY DESTRUCTURING.

const [listOfRestaurants, setListOfRestaurants] = useState(resList) 
AND
const arr = useState([]);
const [listOfRestaurants, setListOfRestaurants] = arr
THESE BOTH ARE SAME.IT JUST ARRAY DESTRUCTURING.
WHAT DOES useState give? => ARRAY.

QUESTION - Why do we need both, why cant we just have one?
variable we need , the function there is actually a trigger for DIFF ALGO, this triggers it, then react finds difference between 2 object
and the update the DOM therefore the state and therefor the UI(re-render the component).
