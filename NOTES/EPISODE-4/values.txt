CONFIG DRIVEN UI - Website driven by data, our website is driven by configs. example => like swiggy there are some offers in bangalore, different in delhi, different in punjab
but website is same, these website are driven by data or config we can say. these are config driven UI. what is config, data in api is the config.


if there are two text together coming from api and you want them to separate with , or - then do this,
data.join(",") this will separate data by ,
data.join("-") thus will separate data by -

when ever you use map in react always give a key in it => because it give a unique identity to every item. NOW QUESTION COMES WHY WE NEED IT?
Imagine we have list of restaurants cards and a new restaurant card is added if there would be no key react wont know which new restaurant is added and where to put that
restaurant card so it will render all the restaurant already present.But if we give each of them a unique id then react will already know which card has come new and whats
its id and it will accordingly put it in the list, so it will only 1 restaurant card rather than all. This is best optimization of app.
