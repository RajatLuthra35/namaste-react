    <!-- now we will write same hello world program in react like we wrote in js -->

    <script>
      const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React!"); // create element is a part of core react so it comes from 1st cdn link.
      // react just created h1 tag in it, but we need to render it somewhere there comes root. root is the place where we will render this tag created by react.

      // react need a root where it can do render/manipulate DOM, so we need to create a root.
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")); // create root and rendering something inside it, its the job of react dom so it comes from 2nd cdn link. Thats y we used ReactDOM rather than React
      root.render(heading);
